description: Open a well-formed GitHub pull request — description from the diff, the right labels, and a linked issue to auto-close on merge
---

Open a pull request in this project's repo from the current branch, with a full
description, the correct labels, and a `Closes #<n>` link so the originating
issue closes automatically on merge. `$ARGUMENTS` is optional: an issue number
(`18` or `#18`) to close, and/or a spec path (e.g. `doc/specs/<slug>.md`) to
enrich the description. If empty, everything is inferred from the branch,
commits, and diff.

This is the counterpart to `/create-issue`: that command turns a spec into an
issue; this one turns the work on a branch into a PR that closes it.

## Step 0 — Load the project profile

Read `.claude/PROJECT.md`. Take from it: the **GitHub repo**, the **base
branch**, the **branch naming** convention, the **label taxonomy**, the **path →
area mapping**, the **build/test commands**, and the **Definition of Done**.

## Ground rules

- **The diff is the source of truth.** Build the description from what actually
  changed on this branch, not from memory or from what was planned.
- Use the repo and base branch from `PROJECT.md`.
- Never open a PR from the base branch itself — it is protected. If the current
  branch is the base branch, stop and tell the user to create a feature branch
  first.
- Never invent a label. Only use labels that exist in the repo (fetched in
  Step 3). If unsure a label fits, leave it off rather than guess.
- Commit and push are outward-facing actions: only run them after showing the
  user what will happen and getting approval (see Step 6).

## Step 1 — Establish the branch state

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git log --oneline origin/<base>..HEAD      # commits unique to this branch
```

- If the branch is the base branch, stop (see Ground rules).
- If `origin/<base>` is missing, fall back to `git log --oneline <base>..HEAD`
  using the resolved base from Step 2.
- Note whether there are uncommitted changes — they must be committed (Step 6)
  before the PR reflects them. Do not commit silently.

## Step 2 — Resolve the base branch

Default to the **base branch** from `PROJECT.md`. Confirm it exists on the remote:

```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin <base>
```

If it does not exist, use the repo's default branch
(`gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'`) and tell
the user you did so. Honor an explicit base if the user passed one in
`$ARGUMENTS` (e.g. `base=develop`).

## Step 3 — Refresh labels (don't trust a stale list)

```bash
gh label list --limit 100
```

Same taxonomy as `/create-issue` (see `PROJECT.md`) — pick from what actually
exists in the live list. Classify from the **diff**, not guesses:

- **Area/module**: which paths did the diff touch? Translate them with the
  **path → area mapping** in `PROJECT.md`. Add more than one only if the change
  genuinely spans areas.
- **Type**: exactly one — new capability → feature; fix → bug; docs-only → docs;
  build/CI → chore.
- **Priority**: exactly one; default to the middle priority unless the work
  signals otherwise.
- If a linked issue (Step 4) or a spec's metadata block names labels, reuse them
  — but still validate against the live list.

## Step 4 — Find the issue to close

Determine the issue number to put in `Closes #<n>`:

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a number (`18` or `#18`), use it.
2. Else parse it from the **branch name** using the **branch naming** convention
   in `PROJECT.md` (typically `<issue-number>-<slug>` → take the leading number).
3. Else scan the branch's commit messages / any referenced spec's **Issue
   metadata** for an issue reference.

Verify the candidate is real and open before relying on it:

```bash
gh issue view <n> --repo <repo> --json number,title,state,labels
```

Show the user the issue you intend to close (number + title) and get a yes before
wiring `Closes #<n>`. If no issue can be found, say so and open the PR without a
`Closes` line rather than guessing a number. Reuse the issue's labels as a
starting point for Step 3.

## Step 5 — Write the PR body

Build the description from the diff and commits. Keep the title short and
imperative; if the branch maps to one clear change, mirror the issue title.
Structure the body with these sections (omit one only if truly N/A):

```markdown
## Summary
<one or two sentences: what this PR does and why>

## Changes
- <notable change 1 — grouped by layer/module, from the diff>
- <notable change 2>

## Testing
<what was run and the result, using the project's build/test command from
 PROJECT.md — e.g. "<build command> — 528 tests, 0 failures">

## Notes
<optional: follow-ups, deferred scope, links to design-spec sections>
<link the spec when there is one, e.g. "Spec: doc/specs/<slug>.md">

Closes #<n>
```

The `Closes #<n>` line (only when Step 4 found and confirmed an issue) makes
GitHub close the issue when the PR merges into the default branch. Fold the
project's **Definition of Done** (from `PROJECT.md`) into the Testing section
where it applies.

## Step 6 — Confirm, push, create

Show the user the final **title, body, labels, base branch, and the issue to
close** in one preview. Create only after they approve.

1. If there are uncommitted changes or unpushed commits, commit (branch first if
   somehow on the base branch) and push. Follow the commit-message convention and
   end commit messages with the required `Co-Authored-By:` trailer. Push the
   branch and set upstream:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin <current-branch>
   ```

2. Create the PR (ready, not draft), one `--label` flag per label:

   ```bash
   gh pr create \
     --repo <repo> \
     --base <base> \
     --title "<title>" \
     --body "<body>" \
     --label "<type>" --label "<area>" --label "<priority>"
   ```

   End the PR body with the required Claude Code attribution line.

Report the created PR URL. If `gh pr create` fails (e.g. a renamed label, or the
branch isn't pushed), read the error, correct the offending flag or push the
branch, and retry — do not silently drop labels or the `Closes` link.
